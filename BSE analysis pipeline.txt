BSE analysis pipeline

1. Download csv files from Firebase storage
2. Check each file to see if subjects are "trying" -- i.e., headphoneCheck>=5, not pressing the same button continuously for over half a task
3. Save csv files to "csv" folder. If excluding, place in "exclude" subfolder.
4. Run extractData.m to convert csv's to mat files.
5. Move the converted csv's to the "converted" subfolder in the "csv" folder.
6. Run subsequent analysis codes.
